## 🧠 Overview

**KindnessChain Video** is a Web3 DApp that flips the script on traditional social media. Instead of chasing likes, users are encouraged to share uplifting video messages. These acts of kindness are rewarded with token-based acknowledgment (coming soon), aiming to build a value system based on positivity rather than popularity.
